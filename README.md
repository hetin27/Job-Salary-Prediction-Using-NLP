# Job-Salary-Prediction-Using-NLP

# üí∞ NLP-Based Job Salary Prediction System

## Project Overview

This project develops a robust Machine Learning model designed to **predict annual job salaries** based on structured features (Company, Location, Employment Status) and, crucially, **unstructured text data** from the job title.

Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the system captures semantic nuance and seniority markers embedded within job titles, providing highly accurate salary estimations specifically tuned for the complexities of the Indian job market.

The final model is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **NLP-Driven Feature Extraction:** Utilizes **TF-IDF Vectorization** on job titles to quantify specialized skills and seniority.
* **Robust Regression Model:** Implements a **Ridge Regression** model, highly effective for handling the sparse, high-dimensional feature space generated by text vectorization and One-Hot Encoding.
* **Full ML Pipeline:** Features a comprehensive Scikit-learn Pipeline for seamless data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling.
* **Web Deployment:** Deployed via **Streamlit** for a user-friendly, real-time prediction interface.
* **Target Transformation:** Applies logarithmic transformation ($\ln(1+x)$) to the target salary variable to ensure a normalized distribution, improving linear model performance.
